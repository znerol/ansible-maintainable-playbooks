Intro
=====

This short guide presents one of many ways to structure ansible playbooks and
inventories for small fleets (i.e., file based inventory). The ideas presented
here have a strong focus on simplicity and maintainability. As a result the
document partially contradict the official `Best Practices`_ (read them
nevertheless).

Basic knowledge about ansible and its `Command Line Tools`_ is a prerequisite.
Also the `Glossary`_ is good help if terms used here are not clear.
