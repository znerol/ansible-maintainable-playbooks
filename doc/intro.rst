Intro
=====

This short guide presents one of many ways to structure ansible playbooks and
inventories for small fleets (i.e., file based inventory). Some of the ideas
presented here contradict the official `Best Practices`_ document (read it
nevertheless).

Basic knowledge about ansible and its `Command Line Tools`_ is a prerequisite.
Also the `Glossary`_ is good help if terms used here are not clear.
